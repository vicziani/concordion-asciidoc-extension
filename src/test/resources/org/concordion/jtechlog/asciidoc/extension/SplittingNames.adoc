== Splitting Names

To help personalise our mailshots we want to have the first name
and last name of the customer. Unfortunately the customer data
that we are supplied only contains full names.

The system therefore attempts to break a supplied full name into
its constituents by splitting around whitespace.

[.example]
=== Example

The full name
concordion:execute[#result = split(#TEXT), John Smith]
will be broken into first name
concordion:assertEquals[#result.firstName, John]
and last name
concordion:assertEquals[#result.lastName, Smith].
